**My name is Travis Royce**, and I am a data scientist with a background in finance and writing, and a recent graduate of the Flatiron School. My undergraduate degree was in finance, and my last position was as a valuation associate. I chose data science because I have always had an affinity towards statistics, and I believe data science and AI will usher in a new era of problem solving and increase productivity at an exponential rate. What could be cooler than that?

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Machine Learning applications for sports, finance, and music. 
- Regarding sports, I have working streamlit applications that predict NBA game winners with 83% accuracy and UFC match winners with 73% accuracy. Both are constantly being updated and upgraded, and I consider both to be in their BETA stages.
- Regarding finance, I have completed the first version of a ![single-stock prediction/classification](https://github.com/tmcroyce/Analyst_Price_Target_Prediction_v1) model based on Analyst Ratings. Further, I am completing a ML application that analyzes the downside risk in specific economic events and provides the user with a calander based upon those risk models, among other projects. 
- Regarding music, I am working on ML auto-production software, which takes many different forms. For instance, one part of the application is a ML chord-writer, which chooses chord progressions based off of reading thousands of billboard top-100 chord progressions. To fully complete the application, many of these smaller ML models are necessary, at least in the way I structure it. 

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that seems interesting or generally like a net benefit for the world!

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my jumpshot. Its spicy.
